# pluralsight_codingchallenge_js
Coding challenge for PluralSight internship application process.

This program reads a list of packages to install as well as their dependencies, represented as an array of strings. It outputs a string of packages in order of installation so all dependencies come before dependent packages.

###Installation
The app runs using NodeJS and mocha tests, so you will need to install Node before you can install and run the app. I am running on Node v4.6.0. 

In the project folder (`pluralsight_codingchallenge_js`), run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

###Running the Tests
In the project folder, run `npm test` to execute the tests.
